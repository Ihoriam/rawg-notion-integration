The idea of the project is create extendable plugin for notion that help fetch some data from different sources of data. User often create notion pages with history of watched movies, tv series or read books or played games. I want to make this project extendable for different sources of data. Like have some universal interface, so if user want to log all tea he tasted before he can add it to notion.
